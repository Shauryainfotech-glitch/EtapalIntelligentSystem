# Security Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Etapal Intelligent System to protect against common web application vulnerabilities and ensure data integrity.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. HTTP Security Headers (Helmet.js)
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Prevents XSS attacks by controlling resource loading
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **Referrer Policy**: Controls referrer information sent with requests
- **Strict Transport Security**: Enforces HTTPS connections

### 2. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
- Configured to allow requests only from authorized origins
- Production: Uses environment-defined allowed origins
- Development: Restricted to localhost:5000
- Credentials support enabled for authenticated requests

### 3. Rate Limiting
- **API Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and DoS attacks
- **Configurable Limits**: 
  - Default: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
  - Customizable via environment variables
- **Targeted Protection**: Applied specifically to `/api/` routes

### 4. Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Zod Schema Validation**: Type-safe input validation
- **Environment Variable Validation**: Ensures required config is present
- **File Upload Validation**: Size and type restrictions

### 5. Authentication & Session Management
- **Passport.js Integration**: Secure authentication framework
- **Session Security**: 
  - Secure session cookies
  - Session store with PostgreSQL
  - Configurable session secrets
- **OAuth Integration**: Support for external authentication providers

### 6. Error Handling & Logging
- **Structured Logging**: Winston-based logging system
- **Error Sanitization**: Production errors don't expose sensitive information
- **Request Logging**: Comprehensive API request tracking
- **Security Event Logging**: Failed authentication attempts and suspicious activity

### 7. File Upload Security
- **File Type Validation**: Restricted to allowed file types
- **Size Limits**: Configurable maximum file sizes
- **Secure Storage**: Files stored outside web root
- **Virus Scanning**: Integration ready for antivirus scanning

### 8. Database Security
- **Parameterized Queries**: Using Drizzle ORM prevents SQL injection
- **Connection Security**: Encrypted database connections
- **Access Control**: Role-based database access

## Environment Configuration

### Required Security Environment Variables

```bash
# Session Security
SESSION_SECRET=your-super-secret-session-key-here  # Min 32 characters

# CORS Configuration
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com,https://api.yourdomain.com

# Rate Limiting
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000  # 15 minutes
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100  # Max requests per window

# File Upload Security
MAX_FILE_SIZE=10485760  # 10MB in bytes
UPLOAD_DIR=uploads      # Secure upload directory

# API Keys (Keep these secret!)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-vision-key
```

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Environment Variables
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Use different secrets for different environments
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Use strong, randomly generated secrets

### 2. HTTPS Configuration
- Always use HTTPS in production
- Configure proper SSL/TLS certificates
- Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)

### 3. Database Security
- Use connection pooling
- Enable database query logging in development
- Regular database backups
- Implement database access auditing

### 4. File Upload Security
- Validate file types on both client and server
- Scan uploaded files for malware
- Store files outside the web root
- Implement file access controls

### 5. API Security
- Implement proper authentication for all API endpoints
- Use API versioning
- Implement request/response validation
- Monitor API usage patterns

## Security Monitoring

### Logging Events
The system logs the following security-relevant events:
- Failed authentication attempts
- Rate limit violations
- File upload attempts
- API errors and exceptions
- Suspicious request patterns

### Log Analysis
- Review logs regularly for security incidents
- Set up alerts for critical security events
- Implement log rotation and archival
- Consider using log analysis tools

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Checklist
1. **Immediate Response**
   - Identify and contain the threat
   - Preserve evidence
   - Assess the scope of impact

2. **Investigation**
   - Analyze logs and system state
   - Identify root cause
   - Document findings

3. **Recovery**
   - Implement fixes
   - Restore services
   - Verify system integrity

4. **Post-Incident**
   - Update security measures
   - Review and improve procedures
   - Communicate with stakeholders

## Security Testing

### Regular Security Assessments
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Static code analysis
- Penetration testing
- Security configuration reviews

### Automated Security Checks
- GitHub Dependabot for dependency updates
- ESLint security rules
- TypeScript strict mode for type safety

## Compliance Considerations

### Data Protection
- Implement data encryption at rest and in transit
- Regular data backups
- Data retention policies
- User data access controls

### Audit Requirements
- Maintain audit logs
- Regular security assessments
- Documentation of security procedures
- Incident response documentation

## Updates and Maintenance

### Security Updates
- Regular dependency updates
- Security patch management
- Configuration reviews
- Security training for developers

### Monitoring and Alerting
- Set up security monitoring
- Configure alerting for security events
- Regular security metric reviews
- Incident response testing
